## Hi there 👋
<img align="left" width="300"  src="3d_compressed.gif">

I am a *software engineer*;            
My primary programming languages are `C#` and `Python`. I enjoy coding and creating `new World();` I've started my carrier officially in <kbd>2009</kbd>. Most of my activities are in the field of logistics, intelligence, the Internet of Things, and automation. I enjoy programming and would ❤<ins>love to share</ins> that pleasure with others, so I decided to record and publish videos for starters focusing on "programming pleasure".
