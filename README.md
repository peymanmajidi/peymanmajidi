## Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Mahan Air EXpress ✈
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **:::ROS**
- 📫 How to reach: send email to [me@peymanmajidi.ir](mailto:me@peymanmajidi.ir)
- 😄 Pronouns: Peyman /pay maan/

I've started my carrier officially in 2009. Most of my activities are in the field of logistics, intelligence, the Internet of Things, and automation.   
I enjoy programming and would love to share that pleasure with others, so I decided to record and publish videos for starters focusing on "programming pleasure💖."
You can take a look at my [Aparat page](https://www.aparat.com/peyman.majidi).   
On this page you can also find the projects in which I participated (of course, the projects from which I allowed to publish the video).
