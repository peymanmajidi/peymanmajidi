## Hi there 👋
![me](sharif2.png)

I am a *software engineer*;            
My primary programming languages are `C#` and `Python`. I enjoy coding and creating new worlds. I've started my carrier officially in <kbd>2009</kbd>. Most of my activities are in the field of logistics, intelligence, the Internet of Things, and automation. I enjoy programming and would <ins>love to share</ins> that pleasure with others, so I decided to record and publish videos for starters focusing on "programming pleasure".   

Here are some ideas to get you started:
